# Machine learning Impact on Graph Neural Network to Analyze Protein 
Secondary Structure

Our research, Our research used GNNs to predict protein secondary structure 
and compared SVM, AdaBoost, KNN, and Decision Tree models. Simulations on 
ccPDB 2.0 confirmed SVM's effectiveness, contributing to machine learning 
research in protein structure prediction.

Language: Python
